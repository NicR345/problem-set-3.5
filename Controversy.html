    <h1>The Many Controversies of Kanye West</h1>
      <h4>Strange Tweets</h4>
        <p>Kanye has had many strange tweets throughout his career.
          The strangest and most bizzare of these may be the infamous
          "Dragon Energy" tweet. This tweet highlights Kanye's praise
          for President Trump and how he relates to him on a "Personal
          level"

      <h4>Meeting with President Trump</h4>
        <p> Recently, Kanye has had a meeting with President to discuss
          issues such as gang violence in Chicago among other things. During
          the meeting Kanye began monologuing multiple times. Despite his
          strange behavior he was praised by the President for being a "Smart
          Cookie"

      <h4>Live Comments</h4>
        <p>Perhaps one of Kanye's most famous controversies is when he was slightly
          inebriated at an awards show. Taylor swift won an award and then Kanye went on
          stage and began ranting on why Beyonce deserved the award more than Swift
