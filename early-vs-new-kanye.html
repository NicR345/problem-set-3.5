    <h1>Early Kanye</h1>
      <h3>Start of His Career</h3>
        <p>At only 26 year old, Kanye released his first album, The
        College Dropout. This album Jumpstarted Kanye's Career
        from just being a kid from Chigago, to the life of a superstar.</p>

      <h3>His Mother</h3>
        <p>In 2007, Kanye payed for his mother's plastic surgery and liposuction
          as a gift for her. Unfortunately, there were complications with the
          surgery and she ended up passing away on November 10th 2007. This
          had a major affect on Kanye's psyche as well as his music.</p>
    <h1>Modern Kanye</h1>
      <h3>The Shift</h3>
        <p>After the Death of his Mother, Kanye felt responsible because
           he payed for the surgery. This caused him to change his overall
           public image as well as his style of music. His music had more
           "artistic" tone instead of pure rap and there was a lot of symbolism</p>
      <h3>Strange Actions</h3>
        <p>Kanye has done some strange and controversal things in recent years,
          such as delaying his most recent album, Yandhi, 2 months so that <head>
          could record in Africa.</p>
